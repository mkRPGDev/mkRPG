\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}
This module handles the orders.
Orders are described in the xml files, and are the actions to be executed
for example when keyboard keys are hitted, or in reaction to other orders.
Every order is thus initialized after the parsing fo the xml files
and the created in this file.

Each order is applied to a target called the emitter meaning that expressions
will be evaluated within this target context ie self.x will be target.x.
Without more precisions, when an event is raised by an order, its target is
transmitted and order generated be this event will share that target.

Set : target.param <- value
Setobj : target.param <- value and value is interpreted as an object
Timer : raise event in value ms
Event : raise event on the target target
Create : create an object of type base, execute the initcode (that allows
    transmitting fields of the target to the created object) and raise event on
    the created object - if an emitter is specified, it is used as a way to fix
    the identifier of the created object since the emitter can't exist
Destroy : destroy the emitter
Condition : raise event if value is True
Move : param being a list (quests for example) move the emitter from 
    source.param to dest.param
Watchdog : start looking after target.param, when it changes to value (that was
    evaluated once by the time of the order), it raises the event
    if once is True, the watchdog is destroy after the first event happened
